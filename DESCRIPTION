Title: Joint Modeling for eQTL Mapping in R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jacob Rhyne, Jessie Jeng, and Eric Chi
Maintainer: Jacob Rhyne <jdrhyne2@ncsu.edu>
Description: This package applies FastLORS to perform eQTL mapping for gene expression and SNP data.  It can also be used to apply the LORS method of Yang et al. (2013).
    The package also contains two pre-screening methods to reduce the number of SNPs before joint modeling: (1) HC-Screening:  a method that selects the top SNPs based on their higher criticism statistics (Rhyne et al. 2018) and (2) LORS-Screening: which fits a marginal estimate and selects the top SNPs per each gene.
